Acquire Valued Shoppers

Consumer brands often offer discounts to attract new shoppers to buy their products. The most valuable customers are those who return after this initial incented purchase. With enough purchase history, it is possible to predict which shoppers, when presented an offer, will buy a new item.
We employ various supervised learning techniques to learn purchase patterns in customers and predict which shoppers are most likely to repeat purchase.
